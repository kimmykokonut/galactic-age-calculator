###  This app will take a user's age input and:
    -Return their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
    -Return their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
    -Return their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
    -Return their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
    -Determine how many years have passed on each planet since a past birthday. 
    -Determine how many years have yet to pass until a future birthday.
